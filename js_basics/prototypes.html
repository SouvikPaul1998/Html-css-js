        /*Property and method look up follows the prototype chain. That is, if you want to look up a property in a, 
        JavaScript will first look at a itself.If it cannot find it there, it will then look at b. 
        If it can't find it in b, then it will look in m, and eventually if it can't find it in m, it will return 
        undefined because m is the 'mother object' 
         and is not linked to any other object.But if you want to look up a property in b, JavaScript will not 
         look into a. It will follow the link direction and if it can't find it in b,
          it will look in m, and will return undefined if it cannot find it in m.*/
